## Hello there! 🙋🏻‍♂️

I’m **Yash** - a Master’s student at **École Polytechnique (IP Paris)** 🎓 focused on **Trustworthy & Responsible AI**, and an aspiring AI researcher 🔬.

I’m mainly interested in **multimodal LMs**, **diffusion models**, and **world models** - especially building systems that are **reliable**, **measurable**, and **useful in practice** ✅.

I’ve published at **KDD (Oral)** 🏆 and **ICCV** on multimodal AI, and I previously built large-scale systems in industry (distributed infra + ML-powered pricing).

I’m also into **competitive programming** ⚡ (including **top-10 global ranks** in multiple CodeChef contests).

### ✨ Highlights
- 📄 **Publications:** **KDD (Oral)**, **ICCV**
- 🎯 **Focus:** multimodal understanding, **LLM/VLM training & post-training**, controllable generation via diffusion  
- 🧰 **Tools:** **Python**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Hugging Face**, **OpenCV**, **FAISS/RAG**, **Docker**, **Git**, **AWS**  
  + systems/data: **Kafka**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **Elasticsearch**, **MySQL**, **Snowflake**
