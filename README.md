## Hello there! 🙋🏻‍♂️

I’m **Yash** — a Master’s student at **École Polytechnique (IP Paris)** focused on **Trustworthy & Responsible AI**, and an aspiring AI researcher.

I’m mainly interested in **multimodal LMs**, **diffusion models**, and **world models** — especially building systems that are **reliable**, **measurable**, and **useful in practice**.

I’ve published at **KDD (Oral)** and **ICCV** on multimodal AI, and I previously built large-scale systems in industry (distributed infra + ML-powered pricing).

I’m also into **competitive programming** (including **top-10 global ranks** in multiple CodeChef contests).

### Highlights
- **Publications:** KDD (Oral), ICCV  
- **Focus:** multimodal understanding, **LLM/VLM training & post-training**, controllable generation via diffusion  
- **Tools:** **Python**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Hugging Face**, **OpenCV**, **FAISS/RAG**, **Docker**, **Git**, **AWS** • plus systems work with **Kafka**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **Elasticsearch**, **MySQL/Snowflake**

### Internship (Mar–Sep 2026)
I’m currently looking for a **research/applied AI internship (Mar–Sep 2026)** focused on **LLM/VLM training/pretraining**, **multimodal AI**, and **diffusion models**.  
If you think I could be a fit, feel free to reach out: **yash.bhardwaj@polytechnique.edu**

### Fun facts
- I love animals — I’ve lived with **7 cats** and **6 dogs**
- I can hold a **10-minute plank**
